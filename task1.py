"""Task description:

- 1 product
- planning for 7 days of production
- production quantaties x[t], t = 0...6
- max production capacity C, 0 <= x[t] <= C, let C = 5
- product can be stored for s days, let s = 3
- we are given a purchases schedule purchases[t], let purchases = [0, 0, 2, 8, 1, 0, 1]
- cumulative sum of purchases is required stock of product for day t
- find x[t] (can be non-unique)

Demonstrate solver behavior under following parameters and expected results:

- all orders are under max capacity per day, no need to make stocks ps = [1, 2, 5, 2, 1, 5, 3]
- production schedule is unique, eg when ps = [0, 0, 15, 0, 0, 0, 0] and xs = [5,5,5,0, 0, 0, 0]
- production schedule not unique (as above)
- production schedule not feasisble eg ps = [0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 0]
